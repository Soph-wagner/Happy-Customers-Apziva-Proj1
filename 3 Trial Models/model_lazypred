Description: using lazypredict python package to test multiple models on the Happy Survey dataset
'''
#our target variable is categorical, so we will use a classification model

# import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyClassifier


# load in data
data = pd.read_csv('ACME-HappinessSurvey2020.csv')

# quick look at the data
print(data.head(5))

#splitting the data into features and target variable
X = data.iloc[:, 1:].values
y = data.iloc[:, 0].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=2)

# fitting lazy classifier
clf = LazyClassifier(verbose=0, ignore_warnings=True, custom_metric=None)
models, predictions = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

print(models)

## if looking for notes on what lazypredict returned without having to run the code
## make sure to look at the Apzive Notes google doc
